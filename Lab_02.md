**2.1. Experiment No. :** 02

**2.2. Experiment Name :** Forming time shifting,auto-correlation and cross-correlation of different types of signal.

**2.3. Theory :**
Time shifting is, as the name suggests, the shifting of a signal in time. This is done by adding or subtracting a quantity of the shift to the time variable in the function. Subtracting a fixed positive quantity from the time variable will shift the signal to the right that means delay by the subtracted quantity, while adding a fixed positive amount to the time variable will shift the signal to the left which means advance by the added quantity.
