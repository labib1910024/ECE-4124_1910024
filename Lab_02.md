**2.3. Theory :**

Time shifting :

Time shifting is, as the name suggests, the shifting of a signal in time. This is done by adding or subtracting a quantity of the shift to the time variable in the function. Subtracting a fixed positive quantity from the time variable will shift the signal to the right that means delay by the subtracted quantity, while adding a fixed positive amount to the time variable will shift the signal to the left which means advance by the added quantity.

Auto correlation & cross correlation :

Sometimes auto correlation is known as serial correlation in the discrete time case, is the correlation of a signal with a delayed copy of itself as a function of delay. Informally, it is the similarity between observations of a random variable as a function of the time lag between them.

In signal processing, cross-correlation is a measure of similarity of two series as a function of the displacement of one relative to the other. This is also known as a sliding dot product or sliding inner-product. It is commonly used for searching a long signal for a shorter, known feature.
